    "\n\nClimatic importance\nEnergy balance effects\nSea ice has an important effect on the heat balance of the polar oceans, since it insulates the (relatively) warm ocean from the much colder air above, thus reducing heat loss from the oceans",
    " This is due to a feedback known as the albedo effect",
    " This is much greater than the reflectivity of the sea (about 10%) and thus the ice also affects the absorption of sunlight at the surface",
    " The Odden (the word is Norwegian for the headland) grows eastward from the main East Greenland ice edge in the vicinity of 72\u201374\u00b0N during the winter because of the presence of very cold polar surface water in the Jan Mayen Current, which diverts some water eastward from the East Greenland Current at that latitude"

  "Aurora": [
    " These can be close to the limit of visibility, but can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow",
    " The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to the high stability of the N2 molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength",
    " It is an aurora because it is caused by precipitation of electrons in the atmosphere but it appears outside the auroral oval, closer to the equator than typical auroras",
    " The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the ionosphere",
    " The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000 km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere",
    " Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere due to increasing density, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually, even green light emissions are prevented",
    " By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral electrojet",
    " At small wavelengths (comparable to the electron inertial length or ion gyroradius), Alfv\u00e9n waves develop a significant electric field parallel to the background magnetic field; this can accelerate electrons due to a process of Landau damping",
    "\" The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859, as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington\u2013Hodgson white light solar flare on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia",
    " This insight was made possible not only due to scientific magnetometer measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the 125,000 miles (201,000 km) of telegraph lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm",
    "\nIn 1778, Benjamin Franklin theorized in his paper Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air: May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air?\nObservations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of Uppsala by Anders Celsius and Olof Hiorter",

  "Brine rejection": [
    "\nAs sea ice ages and thickens, the initial salinity of the ice decreases due to the rejection of brine over time [Fig",

    "\ngravity drainage - Gravity drainage involves the movement of brine due to differences in density between brine in the interior of the ice and brine in the seawater outside of the ice, which occurs due to the development of a buoyancy driven convection system",
    "\nexpulsion - the migration of brine due to cracking produced by thermal expansion of the ice, or pressure caused by the increased volume of the newly formed ice",
    " The density of the water below the newly formed ice increases due to the brine rejection",
    " Because these waters are able to contain a large amount of CO2, they have helped slow the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, thus slowing some aspects of climate change",
    " Studies of the last glacial maximum (LGM) have indicated that a drastic reduction in the production of sea ice and thus reduction of brine rejection, would result in the weakening of the stratification in the global deep oceans and in CO2 release into the shallow oceans and the atmosphere, triggering global deglaciation"

  "Eclipse": [
    " It is because of the non-planar and non-circular differences that eclipses are not a common event",
    " During a lunar eclipse only the umbra and penumbra are applicable, because the antumbra of the Sun-Earth system lies far beyond the Moon",
    " Analogously, Earth's apparent diameter from the viewpoint of the Moon is nearly four times that of the Sun and thus cannot produce an annular eclipse",
    "\n\nDuring a solar eclipse, the Moon can sometimes perfectly cover the Sun because its apparent size is nearly the same as the Sun's when viewed from the Earth",
    " Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue, thus the phrase 'Blood Moon' is often found in descriptions of such lunar events as far back as eclipses are recorded",
    "\n\nOther planets and dwarf planets\nGas giants\nThe gas giant planets have many moons and thus frequently display eclipses",
    "On the other three gas giants (Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) eclipses only occur at certain periods during the planet's orbit, due to their higher inclination between the orbits of the moon and the orbital plane of the planet",
    " The time difference gives the longitude of the observer because every hour of difference corresponded to 15\u00b0 around the Earth's equator",

  ],
  "Equation of time": [
    " However, due to the non-integral number of days in a year, these dates can vary by a day or so from year to year",
    " On Mars the difference between sundial time and clock time can be as much as 50 minutes, due to the considerably greater eccentricity of its orbit",
    " But the numerical values in tables of the equation of time have somewhat changed since then, owing to three factors:\n\ngeneral improvements in accuracy that came from refinements in astronomical measurement techniques,\nslow intrinsic changes in the equation of time, occurring as a result of small long-term changes in the Earth's obliquity and eccentricity (affecting, for instance, the distance and dates of perihelion), and\nthe inclusion of small sources of additional variation in the apparent motion of the Sun, unknown in the 17th century, but discovered from the 18th century onwards, including the effects of the Moon, Venus and Jupiter",
    "  Times in the Almanac were in apparent solar time, because time aboard ship was most often determined by observing the Sun",
    " In the issues since 1834, all times have been in mean solar time, because by then the time aboard ship was increasingly often determined by marine chronometers",
    " In addition to the equation of time, one also has to apply corrections due to one's distance from the local time zone meridian and summer time, if any",
    "\nThe tiny increase of the mean solar day due to the slowing down of the Earth's rotation, by about 2 ms per day per century, which currently accumulates up to about 1 second every year, is not taken into account in traditional definitions of the equation of time, as it is imperceptible at the accuracy level of sundials",
    "291 km/s, according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and its angular speed also varies, and thus the Sun appears to move faster (relative to the background stars) at perihelion (currently around 3 January) and slower at aphelion a half year later",
    " This variation is due to the apparent precession of the rotating Earth through the year, as seen from the Sun at solar midday",
    " A slight yearly variation occurs due to presence of leap years, resetting itself every 4 years",
    " The exact shape of the equation of time curve and the associated analemma slowly change over the centuries, due to secular variations in both eccentricity and obliquity",
    " The offset by \u03c0 = 180\u00b0 = 12 hours from UT is needed because UT is zero at mean midnight while GMHA = 0 at mean noon",
    " Therefore, GMST is an approximation to GAST (and E is an approximation to EOT); eqeq is called the equation of the equinoxes and is due to the wobbling, or nutation of the Earth's axis of rotation about its precessional motion",
    "\nNext, knowing \u03bd, calculate \u03bb from its definition:\n\n\u03bb = \u03bd + \u03bbpThe value of \u03bb varies non-linearly with M because the orbit is elliptical and not circular",
    " Here \u0394t(M) = M + \u03bbp \u2212 \u03b1[\u03bb(M)] is used; in part because small corrections (of the order of 1 second), that would justify using E, are not included, and in part because the goal is to obtain a simple analytical expression",
    " Using two-term approximations for \u03bb(M) and \u03b1(\u03bb) allows \u0394t to be written as an explicit expression of two terms, which is designated \u0394tey because it is a first order approximation in e and in y",
    " When evaluating the numerical expression for \u0394tey as given above, a calculator must be in radian mode to obtain correct values because the value of 2\u03bbp \u2212 2\u03c0 in the argument of the second term is written there in radians",
    " This large discrepancy happens because the difference between the orbital radius at the two locations is only 1 part in a million; in other words, radius is a very weak function of time near periapsis",
    "\nIn all this note that \u0394tey as written above is easy to evaluate, even with a calculator, is accurate enough (better than 1 minute over the 80-year range) for correcting sundials, and has the nice physical explanation as the sum of two terms, one due to obliquity and the other to eccentricity that was used previously in the article"
